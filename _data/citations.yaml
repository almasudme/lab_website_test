  description: In this paper, we propose a novel framework FSProtoTransfer, to detect intrusions in VANETs environment. FSProtoTransfer consists of three phases. The first phase utilizes self-supervised learning to extract latent patterns and robust representations from unlabeled data. In the second phase, few-shot learning with a prototypical network is applied to train the pre-trained model, enabling it to learn effectively from a small number of labeled examples and reducing the reliance on large labeled datasets. The third phase leverages transfer learning with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to perform the

  description: this paper proposes a solution utilizing three Large Language Models (LLMs) - GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-405B, and Gemini-1.5-flash - to automate the characterization of vulnerabilities across 27 categories, grouped into five noun groups. We use both few-shot and zero-shot learning to prompt the LLMs. Our experimental results show that GPT-4o achieves F1-scores of 80%, 90%, 90%, and 73% in the context, impact-method, attack theater, and logical impact noun groups, respectively, using a few labeled samples.
